# Einkaufszettl

## Introduction

Einkaufszettl is a pretty simple app for iOS to help you writing your shopping list and doing your groceries. It has been my very first app for iOS. Unfortunately, it is in a quite poor condition and to motivate myself even more to change that, I decided to open source it on Github.

You can download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/einkaufszettl/id1016435355?l=de&ls=1&mt=8) for free â€” it's available world-wide, although it aims for German speaking countries.

It has an amazing [Website](https://bullenscheisse.de/einkaufszettl/), too. Please visit the homepage to find some screenshots.

## Technology

The code is both Swift and Objective C. A past me wrote some Unit Tests once, another (later) past me deactivated them some months later.

To build the app, just clone this repository, open the project in Xcode, change the bundle identifier, change the development team and hit `CMD+R`.
