# Einkaufszettl

## Introduction

Einkaufszettl is a pretty simple app for iOS to help you writing your shopping list and doing your groceries. It has been my very first app for iOS. Unfortunately, it is in a quite poor condition and to motivate myself even more to change that, I decided to open source it on Github.

You can download it from the [App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/de/app/einkaufszettl/id1016435355?l=de&ls=1&mt=8) for free â€” it's available world-wide, although it aims for German speaking countries. To run the app, you need iOS 11.

It has an amazing [Website](https://bullenscheisse.de/einkaufszettl/), too. Please visit the homepage to find some screenshots.

## Technology

The code is written in both Swift and Objective C. A past me wrote some Unit Tests once, another (later) past me deactivated them some months later. It uses Core Data and doesn't have any third-party dependencies.

To build the app, just clone this repository, open the project in [Xcode 9.3](https://developer.apple.com/news/releases/?id=03292018d), change the bundle identifier and the development team and hit `CMD+R`.
